# 🔁 Circular Linked List Implementation (Java)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Circular Linked List in Java from scratch.
It includes core operations such as:

➕ Add Node

➖ Remove Node

## 🖨️ Print List

This project is created for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice to strengthen understanding of pointer manipulation and circular references.

## 🧠 What is a Circular Linked List?

A Circular Linked List is a linear data structure where:

Each node contains data and a reference to the next node

The last node points back to the head node

There is no null reference at the end

This forms a circular chain structure.

## ⚙️ Features Implemented
➕ Add Operation

Insert node at beginning

Insert node at end

➖ Remove Operation

Delete node from beginning

Delete node from end

## 🖨️ Print Operation

Traverse and display all elements

Stops when traversal reaches head again

## 🏗️ Structure
Node
 ├── data
 └── next

CircularLinkedList
 ├── add()
 ├── remove()
 └── print()

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

Open in any Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)

Compile and run the main class

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understanding circular references

Handling edge cases (empty list, single node)

Pointer manipulation logic

Traversal using do-while loop

## 📚 Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Linked List Fundamentals

Circular Data Structure

Traversal Logic
